# 🛠️ Remote Management of Meshtastic Nodes

This guide outlines how to remotely manage a Meshtastic node using **Admin Channel Keys**, so you can change settings or update firmware without direct physical access.

---

## 🧩 What Is Remote Admin?

Remote admin allows you to **send config changes over the air** to a node in the field — like changing its name, role, or power level — without needing to physically plug it into a computer or use Bluetooth.

Perfect for:
- Updating far-away repeater nodes
- Fixing misconfigured mesh members
- Managing community nodes remotely

---

## 🔐 How It Works

Each Meshtastic node can have **Admin Channel Keys**. These are special keys that let trusted users **remotely configure** the node, regardless of what main channel it’s on.

- Think of it like a private backdoor just for admins.
- The node listens on **both** its normal channel **and** any admin channels you've added.
- Admin commands are only accepted from users who have the correct admin key.

## 🧪 Remote Admin Setup (Step-by-Step)

### 1. ✅ Enable Admin Access
You must explicitly enable remote admin on the node you want to control:

```bash
meshtastic --set remoteAdmin true

2. 🔑 Add an Admin Channel

On your admin device, add a second channel that is marked as admin.

meshtastic --ch-add admin123 --admin

Replace admin123 with your secret admin password/key.

3. 📡 Push the Admin Key to the Node

This channel will now be used for sending admin commands. You don’t need to know the other node’s primary channel — just that it has your admin key enabled.
4. 🛠️ Send Remote Commands

You can now run any meshtastic config or update command, and the node will accept it if it sees the admin key.

Examples:

meshtastic --dest !abc123 --set device.role ROUTER
meshtastic --dest !abc123 --set device.is_fixed_position true

Use --dest to target a specific node.

🔒 Security Tips

    Use strong, unique admin keys

    Avoid sharing admin channels broadly

    Revoke unused admin keys by removing them from the node

    Don’t mix admin and data traffic on the same channel unless you trust everyone on it

🧼 Disabling Admin Access

If you want to stop a node from being remotely managed, turn it off:

meshtastic --set remoteAdmin false

This can only be done locally.
🧠 Notes

    Admin channel traffic is encrypted

    You can add multiple admin channels

    Some config changes may reboot the node

    Not all firmware versions support this – use recent stable builds

🇳🇿 Recommended Use in NZ

For community or rural mesh projects:

    Set a private admin key across all nodes you manage

    Don’t leave repeater nodes with remoteAdmin enabled unless you're confident in channel security

    Track admin keys securely (use a shared password vault or printed QR)
